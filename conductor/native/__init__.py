"""Common code for native submitters.

The code in conductor.native is intended to support GUI submitters that
have been written as first class plugins to their host applications
(clarisse, houdini), as opposed to patching panels into the QT
submitter. As such, there is no DCC specific code and no GUI code in
here.
